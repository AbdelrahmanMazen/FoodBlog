            <h3>Western Food Trends</h3>
                <p>
                    Western cuisine this year leaned hard into comfort, craftsmanship, and bold indulgence. Burgers didn’t disappear,
                    they evolved. Smash burgers with crisp edges, brioche buns, and house-made sauces became the standard rather than the exception. Pizza continued its global reign, especially Neapolitan-style pies with airy crusts and minimalist toppings.

                    Pasta had a strong moment too. Creamy sauces, slow-cooked ragù,
                    and handmade noodles dominated menus and social media feeds. At the same time, plant-based dishes gained popularity,
                    not as substitutes but as stars. Roasted vegetables, grain bowls, and creative salads proved that simplicity done well still wins hearts.

                    Desserts followed nostalgia. Classic brownies, cheesecakes, and croissants returned with small twists like salted caramel, pistachio, or espresso-infused flavors.

            <h3>Eastern Food Highlights (Middle Eastern Cuisine)</h3>
                <p>
                    Eastern food, especially Middle Eastern cuisine, gained even more global appreciation this year. Shawarma remained a street-food icon, served in wraps, bowls, and even fusion-style plates. Falafel continued its rise as a crunchy, flavorful favorite loved by vegetarians and meat-eaters alike.

                    Dips and small plates ruled tables everywhere. Hummus with creative toppings like roasted mushrooms or spicy chili oil became a social dining staple. Manakish, the Levantine flatbread topped with za’atar or cheese, found a wider audience thanks to its simplicity and comfort.

                    Desserts from the region also shined. Kunafa, with its crispy layers and melted cheese, became especially popular, often reimagined with chocolate or cream fillings.

            <h3>Asian Food Favorites</h3>
                <p>
                    Asian cuisine once again proved its global influence. Korean food stayed firmly in the spotlight, with dishes like fried chicken, tteokbokki, and bibimbap enjoying widespread popularity. The balance of spice, sweetness, and texture made these dishes endlessly appealing.

                    Japanese food went beyond sushi. Ramen bowls with rich broths and handmade noodles became comfort food essentials, while street snacks like takoyaki gained attention for their bold flavors. Matcha-flavored desserts continued to trend, especially in drinks and pastries.

                    From Southeast Asia, foods like Thai curries, Vietnamese banh mi, and Indonesian fried rice captured attention with their vibrant spices and fresh ingredients. These dishes celebrated balance, heat, and freshness all in one bite.

            <h3>A Shared Table</h3>
            <p>
                What truly defined food this year wasn’t just specific dishes, but the way cultures blended and influenced each other. Global flavors became more accessible, and people grew more curious about what they eat and where it comes from. Whether it was a burger, a shawarma wrap, or a steaming bowl of ramen, food this year told stories of comfort, culture, and connection.
